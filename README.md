# Porter Stemmer

The Porter stemming algorithm (or _Porter stemmer_) is a process for removing the 
commoner morphological and inflexional endings from words in English. Its main use is 
as part of a term normalisation process that is usually done when setting up 
Information Retrieval systems.


Implementation with explanation of the Porter Stemmer algorithm can be seen in this

## History
The original stemming algorithm paper was written in 1979 in the Computer Laboratory, Cambridge (England), as part of 
a larger IR project, and appeared as Chapter 6 of the final project report,

>London: British Library. (British Library Research and Development Report, no. 5587).

With van Rijsbergen’s encouragement, it was also published in,

And since then it has been reprinted in
